# React/Redux Project Planning Resources

## Introduction

The final project is where you get to demonstrate all that you have learned
throughout your time as a student at Flatiron!

**Use this document to help you complete this [planning form][]**

## How to Get Started On a Successful Project Build

1. Read through the project requirements here carefully before getting started.

2. Come up with a project idea of your own, and devote some time to a planning
   session. Think about the following:

   a. What will your app do? What is the user
   experience?
   b. What data will you store in your database?
   c. What data will you keep track of in your redux store? Will you need local
   state in any of your components, too?

[Use this form][[planning form]] to jot down your plans and submit it to us so we can see what you
are planning!

We are here to help!  Each week, there are Open Office Hour [study groups][]
specifically designed to help with React/Redux project questions. Keep an eye
out for our React/Redux topic-based [study groups][], too!

### Making a User story

- Who is your User?
- What is their pain point?
- How do they use our solution to overcome this problem?

> **Example**: Sally is trying to get into hiking and wants to keep track of her
> favorite trails.  Sally wants a place to write notes about each trail and her
> experiences:
>
> - Sally is able to enter trail information and notes through a form
> - She can navigate to an index page to see all her previous hikes
> - Sally can see more detailed information about a specific hike by clicking on
>   it
